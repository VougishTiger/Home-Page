            <li><h3>My First Website!</h3></li>
            <h4>Created my very first website, was a basic html page! But that built upon using css nexton a another project then led to me making my official website which was a combitnation of html and css that i learned in class.</h4>
            <li><h3>My First Solana Memecoin Website!</h3></li>
            <h4>This was a big side project i ended up starting! So i just made a funny meme website that was for practice which then i turned into a idea. Started getting the basics ready and now ill be launching my very own memecoin on the Solana platform. During the life of this memecoin i will be also creating a meme generator website, which should support the community of this memecoin as it lets the people of the community create their own memes within my meme world. I expect this coin to create a community that acts like a hub and a home for everyone from around the world! I have already created a Telegram Group and a Twitter for the coin and i am super excited for this launch.</h4>
            <li><h3>My future Bot project!</h3></li>
            <h4>This project is something i plan doin gin a month or two! This is a special project so i am still in the planing phase! What you are about to read is very confidential. Any leak of this information may be punishble by the Bro Code to the highest extent! This project includes me creating a bot that will intially take information from a certain website called DexScreener. DexScreener is a Dex Website that keeps tracks of every live memecoin on every live platform! I want my bot to focus on all memecoins, new or old, on the Solana platform. Then i want the bot to run those coins through two programs that will seperate the Scam coins from Good projects! Once it seperates the scams and takes them out, the bot then will run my own programmed checks that will seperate the memecoins with max potential to no potential. From there i want my bot to find coins with max potential that are bottomed out on the charts and buy in low, and sell high! follow the charts and chart patterns and make the correct decision that would bring me the best profit.</h4>
