      <h2>Who Is Robin Singh?</h2>
        <h3>Born in 1994, Robin singh immigrated to america back in 2004. Back in those days it was tough for a southeast asian or middle easter to move to america due to the boiling conflict in the middle east and the events that would take place on September 11th 3 years prior to Robin moving to America! Now you would assume people would not blame a southeast asian indian for events that some terrorist did from the middle east, but they did! When Robin turned 18 he enlisted in the United States Army, active duty. After his career in the army, Robin got out and jumped around in different careers before getting his CNA license in 2020 and now working towards becoming an amazing coder. My plan is to get my certificate and try to get a job in the Bay Area! That is where all the tech jobs are so i am super excited to work out there. Robin speaks four languages and has alot of different skills in he work world. Some of those skills may include customer service expirence, heavy machine operator, medic combat training, real world military expirence, and Tacticle Military Training.</h3>
